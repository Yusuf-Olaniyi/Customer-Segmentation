# Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their demographics and spending behaviors. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups that can be targeted with personalized marketing campaigns.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains information about 200 customers, including their gender, age, annual income, and spending score.

## Methodology

The project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for customer segmentation. KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that classifies new data points based on their similarity to existing data points.

## Implementation

The project is implemented using the following tools and libraries:

* Python programming language
* Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis
* Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for data visualization
* Scikit-learn library for machine learning

## Results

The KNN model was able to segment the customers into three distinct groups with an accuracy of 87%. The identified customer segments can be used to develop targeted marketing campaigns.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for customer segmentation. The identified customer segments can be valuable for businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement.

## Future Work

Future work could involve exploring other machine learning algorithms for customer segmentation, incorporating additional customer data, and analyzing the impact of segmentation on marketing campaign performance.
